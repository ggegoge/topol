# topol
topological sorting of a graph. written in ocaml. for my university
course actually

within this branch I've used __Kahn's algorithm__ for topological
sorting. It may be slightly slower but on the other hand it is a
simpler concept. Or maybe I've simply couldn't manage to properly
implement this and that's why it is slower. You can ask wikipedia for
more information about Kahn's algorithm
