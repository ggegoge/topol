# topol
topological sorting of a graph. written in ocaml. for my university course actually

all tests from the `tests` folder are written by other people and i
just use them to test whether my implementation is indeed working
properly. They are all on the GNUPL or WFTPL licenses. The same
applies to the bash file `testuj.sh`.
