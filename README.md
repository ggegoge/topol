# topol
topological sorting of a graph. written in ocaml. for my university
course actually

_For further details regarding this project as a whole see
the [notes](notes.org) file written in Polish with a more thourough description._

On this branch I've implemented the __dfs algorithm__ for topological
sorting. For further info you can
consult
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search) and
the `topol.ml` file itself.


### tests
all tests from the `tests` folder are written by other people and i
just use them to test whether my implementation is indeed working
properly. They are all on the GNUPL or WFTPL licenses. The same
applies to the bash file `testuj.sh`.
